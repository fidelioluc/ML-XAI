# Documentation

This folder contains high-level documentation for the project:

- **`pipeline_plan.pdf`**: A theoretical overview of the modular machine learning pipeline, detailing the vectorization techniques, classifier stages, and evaluation process.
- **`project_poster.pdf`**: A summary poster presenting the final results, including key findings, performance comparisons, and visuals from the project.

These documents provide both the initial plan and the final outcome for reference and presentation purposes.
